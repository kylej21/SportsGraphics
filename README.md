# SportsGraphics

Some sports project using Three.js and OpenGL.

# Project setup

Just like in class assignments 1 and 2:

`npm install`

`npx vite`

Three.js and Vite should already be included in the package.json, but feel free to import any
other needed packages

# File Organization

I'm not sure how extensive the project will be, so I've broken the file structure into some modular
folders.

1. public -> This is for all assets like textures, GIFs, downloaded models, etc. Special folder accessible to all files.

2. models -> The models folder is for all the objects. Represented as classes for easy reuse.

3. transformations -> I haven't added this yet, but I'm thinking if we have heavy matrix mult
   we should put them in one folder.
